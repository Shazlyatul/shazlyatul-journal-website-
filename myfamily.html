Family is the cornerstone of my life, providing love, support, and a sense of belonging. I am incredibly grateful for the bond I share with my family members.
<p>
My parents, my dad and my mom, have always been my biggest role models. Their unwavering support and encouragement have shaped who I am today. They taught me the value of hard work, kindness, and perseverance.
<p>
I am also blessed to have two beautiful sisters as my sibling, who are my closest friends and confidants. Growing up, we shared countless adventures, from family vacations to late-night conversations. Even though we are now spread out in different places, our bond remains strong, and we make it a point to stay connected.
<p>
Family gatherings are always special, filled with laughter, delicious food, and cherished memories. Whether it's celebrating holidays or simply spending time together, these moments are the ones I hold closest to my heart.

My best friend, Dayangku Siti Mariyam, is an extraordinary person who has been a constant source of support, joy, and inspiration in my life. We met in 2019 at our secondary school where we were a classmate, and since then, our bond has only grown stronger. Dayangku is someone I can always count on, whether I'm facing challenges or celebrating successes. She has an incredible ability to listen and offer thoughtful advice, making me feel understood and valued. Our shared experiences, from a random "hi" to late-night conversations, have created a treasure trove of memories that I hold dear. With Dayangku's unwavering loyalty and genuine kindness, I feel truly blessed to have such an amazing person by my side.
