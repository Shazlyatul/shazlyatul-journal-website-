<h2 style="background-color:#D2A23D; font-family:broadway; text-align:center;">Kindergarten Era &#128212; </h2>
<p>

School was another significant part of my childhood. I remember my first day of kindergarten at Pra Arif Sekolah Kebangsaan Jalan Raja Syed Alwi, feeling both excited and nervous. The classroom was a new world, filled with colorful posters, books, and toys. My teacher, Mrs. Shafinaz, was kind and nurturing, helping us ease into this new chapter of our lives. Learning to read and write opened up new avenues of exploration and creativity for me.

<p>
School days are a tapestry woven with memoriesâ€”some vivid, others fleeting, but each leaving an indelible mark on my journey of growth and discovery. From the bustling corridors of primary school to the more structured halls of secondary education, my years in school were filled with moments of learning, friendship, and self-discovery.

<p>

Transitioning to secondary school marked a significant milestone in my educational journey. The landscape shifted from one classroom with one teacher to multiple subjects and specialized educators. It was a time of adjustment, but also of discovery. My secondary school name is Sekolah Menengah Kebangsaan Perlis.
